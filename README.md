# FRET-efficiency-over-time
This code calculates the FRET efficiency from single-molecule traces exported from Igor and saves FRET efficiency traces individually. Then it calculates and plots how the FRET efficiency behaves with respect to the position in the traces i.e. for example if and how the FRET efficiency changes depending on the total illumination time.

## How to

first run calcFRETfromIgor.m

then run plotFREThistosovertime.m

everything else is commented within the code
